In the United States, groundhogs are said to predict the future of the winter season's end - if it’s going to stay a bit longer, most often six weeks, or if it’s going to give way for the upcoming spring. If the ceremonial hog sees a shadow, you're going to have to wait a bit longer for the warm weather.

It’s quite fun to watch, although it must be a bit of a hassle for the street sweepers the next day.

In Deutschland, people really tend to look out for one another. If you happen to drop your ‘hand shoe’ in the cold and dreary winter, rest assured that when retracing your steps in search of it, the glove may well be skewered on the branch of a tree. Doing so when encountering an item that appears to be lost is commonplace in German society in order to make it more visible when the owner comes searching for it.Christmas Comes Early</div>

It is believed that wearing red underwear during the whole year may prevent misfortunes from befalling them in the year to come. Why so? There are 12 animals respectively representing the 12 zodiac years. Legend has it that the current animal is on duty in heaven, so it cannot take care of the people of its sign in the human world.

        <div class="paragraph">If you are ready for a trip and some Turkish are there to send you off, you may wonder why they have a small cup of water in their hands. According to our traditions, we spill water after the passengers leave. It is like having a good wish for them. It means “like water, go and come back easy and fast.” These days, older people still do it, but younger ones often don’t. It is sad because it is a nice tradition with such a positive wish. I remember when we went on a vacation with my family, my grandmother spilled the water behind us. When I watched her from inside of the car, I felt so safe. It has had a special meaning for me since then.

The idea is to wait until the temperature outside reaches an exceptionally low temperature and go into a sauna where you reach the higher temperature. You then open the door and run around some designated marker wearing only boots so achieving a difference of 300F before re-entering the building to warm up again.

<div class="mobile-sub-title">Antartica</div>
<div class="mobile-paragraph">Chinese people usually wear (or are forced by their mothers to wear) red underwear on Ben Ming Nian (Zodiac Year of Birth), which is the current year in a cycle of 12 zodiac years. It is believed that wearing red underwear during the whole year may prevent misfortunes from befalling them in the year to come. Why so? There are 12 animals respectively representing the 12 zodiac years. Legend has it that the current animal is on duty in heaven, so it cannot take care of the people of its sign in the human world. That’s when the red underwear comes to the rescue.

<div class="mobile-paragraph">When you get into a cab it is presupposed that you will start quick chitchat with the driver. If you got off without knowing his or her life trajectory, you failed it. This is one of the good Australian customs. Drivers in Australia are super-friendly and they understand that one of the cultural norms there is to chat with passengers. So stay off your phones!

<div class="mobile-paragraph">Culturally speaking, Germans are also more customarily friendly and helpful than other northern European nations, where the norm is to keep to oneself. In Deutschland, people really tend to look out for one another. If you happen to drop your ‘hand shoe’ in the cold and dreary winter, rest assured that when retracing your steps in search of it, the glove may well be skewered on the branch of a tree. Doing so when encountering an item that appears to be lost is commonplace in German society in order to make it more visible when the owner comes searching for it.Christmas Comes Early

<div class="mobile-paragraph">Predicting the future is hard for people, no one can do it with 100 percent accuracy, but animals are more predictable. In the United States, groundhogs are said to predict the future of the winter season's end - if it’s going to stay a bit longer, most often six weeks, or if it’s going to give way for the upcoming spring. If the ceremonial hog sees a shadow, you're going to have to wait a bit longer for the warm weather.

 <div class="mobile-paragraph">On New Year’s Eve in Buenos Aires, office workers around the city tear up their calendars into tiny little pieces and throw them all out of the window. This tradition isn’t just to create some pretty confetti, the belief is that they are letting go of all the negativity of the passing year to allow positive things to come in the next. It’s quite fun to watch, although it must be a bit of a hassle for the street sweepers the next day.

 <div class="mobile-paragraph">If you are ready for a trip and some Turkish are there to send you off, you may wonder why they have a small cup of water in their hands. According to our traditions, we spill water after the passengers leave. It is like having a good wish for them. It means “like water, go and come back easy and fast.” These days, older people still do it, but younger ones often don’t. It is sad because it is a nice tradition with such a positive wish. I remember when we went on a vacation with my family, my grandmother spilled the water behind us. When I watched her from inside of the car, I felt so safe. It has had a special meaning for me since then.
